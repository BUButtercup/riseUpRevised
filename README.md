# Description
This application is a revised version of [Rise Up](https://github.com/BUButtercup/riseUp), the third group project I worked on during my time at the UW Full Stack Bootcamp. This is a forum website dedicated to whole person wellness and peer support. Updated components include styling, and the added ability to follow users, like/unlike posts, flag posts that are potentially harmful for review by the moderator (these will populate in the moderator's list of all posts).
